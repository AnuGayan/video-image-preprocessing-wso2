#Object Detection 
Object detection is the way of finding instances of semantic objects of a certain class such as humans, building, cars etc. Humans have this ability due to their intelligence, even though machines do not have a brain this can be achieved with image processing and video processing techniques. There are several approaches for object detection. Below mentioned 3 approaches can be highlighted.
