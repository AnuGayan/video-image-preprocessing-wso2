#Object Detection 
Object detection is the way of finding instances of semantic objects of a certain class such as humans, building, cars etc. Humans have this ability due to their intelligence, even though machines do not have a brain this can be achieved with image processing and video processing techniques. There are several approaches for object detection. Below mentioned 3 approaches can be highlighted.

- OpenCV
- Tensorflow
- Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit

This repo consists with the research on OpenCV and Tensorflow for Plane Detection and Human Detection.
 
[OpenCV_HumanDetection](https://github.com/wso2-incubator/video-image-preprocessing-wso2/tree/master/OpenCV_HumanDetection) is consists with Intellij project which was developed using OpenCV to detect humans in a  video.

[OpenCV_PlaneDetection](https://github.com/wso2-incubator/video-image-preprocessing-wso2/tree/master/OpenCV_PlaneDetection) is a Intellij project which was developed using OpenCV to detect planes in a video.

[OpenCV_Plane_Cascade_Training](https://github.com/wso2-incubator/video-image-preprocessing-wso2/tree/master/OpenCV_Plane_Cascade_Training) will guide you through the cascade training process. It consists with all the details and the resources for training a plane detection cascade.

[Tensorflow_Plane_Retrain](https://github.com/wso2-incubator/video-image-preprocessing-wso2/tree/master/Tensorflow_Plane_Retrain) is consists with a script and a training data set for plane and bird classifier.
