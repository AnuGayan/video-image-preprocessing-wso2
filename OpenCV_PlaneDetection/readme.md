##OpenCV_PlaneDetection

####Prerequisites

- OpenCV

To run this project OpenCV should be installed in to the machine.

To install OpenCV, please refer to this [link](https://github.com/wso2-incubator/video-image-preprocessing-wso2/blob/master/OpenCV_install.txt)

Then open the project using intellij idea and set the oracle java as the sdk.

All the required files are in resource folder.  There are few cascades inside the cascade folder. You can change the cascade and check the detection accuracy.

Apart from that you can train one of your own cascade by using [OpenCV_Plane_Cascade_Training](https://github.com/wso2-incubator/video-image-preprocessing-wso2/tree/master/OpenCV_Plane_Cascade_Training).
